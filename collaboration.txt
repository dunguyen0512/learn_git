## many people work on one branch. 
## will have confliction.
## review code before update 
## git history is a mess.
## work on difference branch to reduce conflictions.

git brand
creating new brand to dev 
git head (= point) - work as a bookmark.
show the location of the working directory.
Head has 2 working status: "normal head" and "deteached head"
normal head: head will move in parallel with the main or the latest commit. 
deteached head: move the head to previous commit, if no branch is created at this time, it will be disappeared. 
to move to a difference branch: use git checkout main or git switch feature.

how to process a deteached Head
git checkout <commit_hash>
git branch <new_branch> # creating new branch
git switch <new_branch> # switch to new branch

when creating a new branch on main, it will contain all the previous commits from main.
Remember to switch to new branch using "git switch <new_branch>"

git branch -D <branch_name> # hard delete, no need to merge.

############ classify git switch - git checkout ####
