## many people work on one branch. 
## will have confliction.
## review code before update 
## git history is a mess.
## work on difference branch to reduce conflictions.
## for example, new application is develop and merge to main branch. (update utilities)

git brand
creating new brand to dev 
git head (= point) - work as a bookmark.
show the location of the working directory.
Head has 2 working status: "normal head" and "deteached head"
normal head: head will move in parallel with the main or the latest commit. 
deteached head: move the head to previous commit, if no branch is created at this time, it will be disappeared. 
to move to a difference branch: use git checkout main or git switch feature.

how to process a deteached Head
git checkout <commit_hash>
git branch <new_branch> # creating new branch
git switch <new_branch> # switch to new branch

when creating a new branch on main, it will contain all the previous commits from main.
Remember to switch to new branch using "git switch <new_branch>"

#################delete branch #################
git branch -d <branch_name> # delete the branch already merged to main.
git branch -D <branch_name> # hard delete, no need to merge.

############ classify git switch - git checkout ####

git switch # work with branches. 
git checkout # work with branches, commits, and files.
git checkout <filename> # recover file 
git checkout <hash_key> # move to previous commit. 
Example: a new branch is created, and when showing all the loggile. new_branch contains all the commits. 
cmd: aeed82d (HEAD -> new_branch, main) practice branch -checkout.
when having commit on new_branch, all the changes will be disappeared on main. 
The new changes only appears on new_branch.

#### merge new_branch to main ####
2 ways to merge a new_branch. Fast forward merge (FFM) and three-way merge(TWM). 
FFM: git merge <new_branch> ## no commit on main branch. (no conflictions)
TWM: git merge <new_branch>## Has several new commits on main branch.  need to check all the conflictions 

##### git difference ####
compare 2 files
git diff # compare current version in working directory to last commit
# only appears when the filed was not added. (not in staging)
git diff --staged # compre when add with last commit. 
advanced  "git diff" can use to compare 2 commits,compare 2 branches. 
Most of the the software usually have fix version. Using this to understand what has been changed.
git diff <commit1> <commit2> --<filename> 
git diff <branch1> <branch2> --<filename>
Example:
diff --git a/collaboration.txt b/collaboration.txt ### compare files
index f1d282f..f7100d1 100644 ## hash version
--- a/collaboration.txt ## old version
+++ b/collaboration.txt ## new version
